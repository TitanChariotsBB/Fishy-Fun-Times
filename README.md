# Fishy Fun Times

Fishy Fun Times was a game created for my first project in COMP 441 (2D Game Design and Development) while pursuing my degree in Computer Science at Grove City College. The goal of the game is to eat fish that are smaller than you, and to avoid being eaten by bigger fish and stung by jellyfish. This game will accept directional control from wasd and arrow keys (and game controllers should work). The logic was programmed in C#. As the game progresses, more fish and jellyfish will spawn, and the average size of the enemy fish will increase, increasing the difficulty even while the player becomes capable of eating more small fish. I made the art assets myself using Inkscape, and composed the soundtrack myself using Bitwig Studio.
